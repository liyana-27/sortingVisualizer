### Introduction

---

This is a code repository for my Sorting Visalizer website which can be viewed [here](https://liyana-27.github.io/sortingVisualizer) or at <https://liyana-27.github.io/sortingVisualizer>.

I built this to get a better grip on the sorting algorithms. I referred Clement's Visualiser for the basic logic and then applied that to build my own webpage that handles three sorting algorithms - Merge sort, Quick sort and Bubble sort while also displaying the basic logic behind the algorithms as well as the **worst case time complexity** and the **auxiliary space used**.

The website has the following features:

- A Navigation Bar that allows the user to generate a new array as well as select a sorting algorithm to visualise
- Descriptions of the algorithms when clicked (the user would ideally go through the descriptions before making the algorithm choice)
- A 'Start Sorting' button so that the user has control over sorting
- Automatic disabling of all buttons when a sorting algorithm is running
- Automatic re-enabling of all buttons once the algorithm is done executing
- Use of colors to visualise the process:
  - Black - unsorted array
  - Grey - yet to be sorted elements
  - Deep Red - compared elements
  - Green - sorted array
